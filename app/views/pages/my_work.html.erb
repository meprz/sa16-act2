        <ul>
            <li>
                Uses JavaScript for the emulation logic, which simulates the CPU, the memory, and the sound systems of both the NES and SNES consoles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Makes use of the HTML5 Canvas to render games in the browser, while also preserving the original look and feel of the games.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implements a secure system to load the games' ROMs through safe user uploads.
            </li>
        </ul>

                Created the very 1st AI that passes the Turing Test (those other guys are lying).

            <li>
                Transforms normal and everyday cloud computing into the 1st sentient, self-aware network capable of optimizing itself in real-time (relax, we're not in any danger).
            </li>
            <li>
                Uses flux processors (shout out to Doc Brown!): a new processor which uses synthetic synapses to increase computational speed/efficiency.
            </li>
